# Tab Menu
This is a recovery of Frank Yan's Chrome extension "Tab Menu" (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/galfofdpepkcahkfobimileafiobdplb). It was one of my favorite chrome extensions, but it unfortunately disappeared from Chrome Web Store since around mid 2013.

The original description of the extension was:
> Select, close, rearrange, and search your tabs from a toolbar menu!

The current release is available at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-menu/hjeifjagcmihmdcmnfjelgdgpibefmfc
