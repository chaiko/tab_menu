# Tab Menu

**Tab Menu** is a minimalist tabs manager for Chrome. It enables you to search, switch, rearrange, and close tabs from the toolbar menu. It supports both mouse operations as well as keyboard operations.

Get it [from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-menu/hjeifjagcmihmdcmnfjelgdgpibefmfc).

## Credits

This Chrome extension was originally created by Frank Yan, with extension ID `galfofdpepkcahkfobimileafiobdplb` on Chrome Web Store. Frank stopped maintaining it, and the original extension disappeared from Chrome Web Store since around mid 2013. It was one of my favorite Chrome extensions.

I recovered it from my installation and maintain it [on GitHub](https://github.com/chaiko/tab_menu), for the sake of those who love it.
